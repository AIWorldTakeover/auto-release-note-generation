# Development Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for building the auto release note generator. It breaks down the work into phases with clear deliverables and success criteria.

---

## Overview

The implementation follows a bottom-up approach, building core data structures first, then adding Git integration, and finally AI-powered summarization. Each phase delivers working functionality that can be tested and validated.

- **Core Data Models**: All foundational Pydantic models with comprehensive validation
- **Test Infrastructure**: Property-based testing, factories, and 80%+ coverage
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Full GitHub Actions workflow with security scanning
- **Type Safety**: Strict mypy configuration and full type annotations

### üîÑ In Progress
- **Git Integration**: GitWrapper implementation pending
- **CLI Foundation**: Basic command-line interface

### ‚ùå Not Started
- **AI Integration**: PydanticAI summarization
- **Processing Pipeline**: Extractor, Grouper, Assembler

## Phase 2: Release Assembly

### Goal

  - [x] `ChangeMetadata` - Metadata for logical changes with validation
  - [ ] `Change` - Logical grouping of commits
  - [ ] `Release` - Complete release representation
  - [ ] Commit grouping logic (merge commits, linear history)

- [ ] **Processing Pipeline** (`core/`)
  - [ ] `Extractor` - Git data to Commit objects
  - [ ] `Grouper` - Commits to Change objects  
  - [ ] `Assembler` - Changes to Release objects
  - [ ] `Orchestrator` - Pipeline coordination

  - [ ] Markdown release notes template
  - [ ] JSON export for programmatic use
  - [ ] Basic formatting and structure

### Success Criteria
- Generate readable release notes without AI
- Support both merge-based and linear Git workflows
- Handle edge cases (empty releases, large commit ranges)
- Output includes proper change categorization

### Testing
- Test grouping logic with various Git histories
- Validate output format and structure
- Performance testing with large commit ranges

## Phase 3: AI Summarization

### Goal
Integrate AI-powered summarization to generate intelligent, context-aware release notes.

### Deliverables
- [ ] **AI Summary Models** (`data_models/ai_summaries.py`)
  - [ ] `BaseSummary` with confidence and metadata
  - [ ] `CommitSummary` with impact levels and categories
  - [ ] `ChangeSummary` with user impact and breaking changes
  - [ ] `ReleaseSummary` with highlights and migration notes

- [ ] **AI Integration** (`ai_models/`)
  - [ ] `PromptProvider` interface and file-based implementation
  - [ ] PydanticAI agent configuration
  - [ ] `CommitSummarizer`, `ChangeSummarizer`, `ReleaseSummarizer`
  - [ ] Error handling and retry logic

- [ ] **Basic Prompts** (`prompts/base/`)
  - [ ] Commit summarization prompt
  - [ ] Change summarization prompt  
  - [ ] Release summarization prompt
  - [ ] Base persona definition

### Success Criteria
- Generate AI summaries for commits, changes, and releases
- AI output validates against structured schemas

## Implementation Dependencies

### Phase Dependencies
- Phase 2 requires Phase 1 completion
- Phase 3 can begin once Phase 2 data models are stable
- Phase 4 requires working AI integration from Phase 3
- Phase 5 can be developed in parallel with Phase 4

### External Dependencies
- **Git**: All phases require Git repositories for testing
- **AI Service**: Phase 3+ requires access to PydanticAI-compatible models
- **Testing Data**: Need diverse Git repositories for validation

### Risk Mitigation
- **AI Service Limits**: Implement fallback modes and local testing
- **Complex Git Histories**: Start with simple repositories, add complexity gradually
- **Performance Issues**: Build performance testing into each phase
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict phase boundaries and defer nice-to-have features
